The Time Machine



An Invention



by H. G. Wells





III. The Time Traveller Returns





I think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time

Machine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are

too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him;

you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush,

behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the

matter in the Time Travellerâs words, we should have shown _him_ far

less scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a

pork-butcher could understajd`Filby. But the Time Traveller had more

than a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things

that would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his

hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who

took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were

somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was

like furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I donât think any of

us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that

Thursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in

most of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical

incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter

confusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied

with the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the

Medical Man, whom I met on Friday at the LinnÃ¦an. He said he had seen a

similar thing at TÃ¼bingen, and laid considerable stress on the

blowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not

explain.



The next Thursday I went again to RichmondâI suppose I was one of the

Time Travellerâs most constant guestsâand, arriving late, found four or

five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man was

standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his

watch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller, andââItâs

half-past seven now,â said the Medical Man. âI suppose weâd better have

dinner?â



âWhereâsââ?â said I, naming our host.



âYouâve just come? Itâs rather odd. Heâs unavoidably detained. He asks

me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if heâs not back. Says

heâll explain when he comes.â



âIt seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,â said the Editor of a

well-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.



The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself who

had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the Editor

aforementioned, a certain journalist, and anotherâa quiet, shy man with

a beardâwhom I didnât know, and who, as far as my observation went,

never opened his mouth all the evening. There was some speculation at

the dinner-table about the Time Travellerâs absence, and I suggested

time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor wanted that

explained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of

the âingenious paradox and trickâ we had witnessed that day week. He

was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor

opened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it

first. âHallo!â I said. âAt last!â And the door opened wider, and the

Time Traveller stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. âGood

heavens! man, whatâs the matter?â cried the Medical Man, who saw him

next. And the whole tableful turned towards the door.



He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared

with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to

me greyerâeither with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually

faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on itâa cut

half-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense

suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been

dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just

such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in

silence, expecting him to speak.



He said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motion

towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it

towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked

round the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his

face. âWhat on earth have you been up to, man?â said the Doctor. The

Time Traveller did not seem to hear. âDonât let me disturb you,â he

said, with a certain faltering articulation. âIâm all right.â He

stopped, held out his glass for more, and took it off at a draught.

âThatâs good,â he said. His eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came

into his cheeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certain

dull approval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Then

he spoke again, still as it were feeling his way among his words. âIâm

going to wash and dress, and then Iâll come down and explain things....

Save me some of that mutton. Iâm starving for a bit of meat.â



He looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he

was all right. The Editor began a question. âTell you presently,â said

the Time Traveller. âIâmâfunny! Be all right in a minute.â



He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I

remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and

standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing

on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the door

closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how he

detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was

wool-gathering. Then, âRemarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,â I

heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And this

brought my attention back to the bright dinner-table.



âWhatâs the game?â said the Journalist. âHas he been doing the Amateur

Cadger? I donât follow.â I met the eye of the Psychologist, and read my

own interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time Traveller limping

painfully upstairs. I donât think anyone else had noticed his lameness.



The first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man,

who rang the bellâthe Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting at

dinnerâfor a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his knife and fork

with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The dinner was resumed.

Conversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps of

wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his curiosity. âDoes our

friend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or has he his

Nebuchadnezzar phases?â he inquired. âI feel assured itâs this business

of the Time Machine,â I said, and took up the Psychologistâs account of

our previous meeting. The new guests were frankly incredulous. The

Editor raised objections. âWhat _was_ this time travelling? A man

coeldnât cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?â

And then, as the idea came home to him, he resorted to caricature.

Hadnât they any clothes-brushes in the Future? The Journalist too,

would not believe at any price, and joined the Editor in the easy work

of heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They were both the new kind of

journalistâvery joyous, irreverent young men. âOur Special

Correspondent in the Day after Tomorrow reports,â the Journalist was

sayingâor rather shoutingâwhen the Time Traveller came back. He was

dressed in ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look

remained of the change that had startled me.



âI say,â said the Editor hilariously, â¬these chaps here say you have

been travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us ¡ll about little

Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?â



The Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word.

He$smiled quietly, in his old way. âWhereâs my mutton?â he said. âWhat

a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!â



â¬Story!â cried the Editor.



âStory be damned!â said the Time Traveller. âI want something to eat. I

wonât say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And

the salt.â



âOne word,â said I. âHave you been time travelling?â



âYes,â said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his head.



âIâd give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,â said the Editor. The

Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it with

his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring at his

face, started convulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the dinner

was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions kept on rising to

my$¬ips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalist

tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie$ ¯tter. The

Time Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the

appetite of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched

the Time Traveller through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even

more clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity and

determination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller

pushed his plate away, and looked round us. âI suppose I must

apologise,â he said. â­Y was simply v¤arving. Iâve had a most amazing

time.â He reached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end. â¬But come

into the smoking-room. Itâs too long a story to tell over greasy

plates.â And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the

adjoining room.



âYou have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the ­achine?â he said

to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests.



âBut the thingâs a mere paradox,â said the Editor.



â¬I canât argue tonight. I donât mind telling ¹ou the story, but I canât

argue. I will,â­ ¨e went on, â­tell you the story of what has happened$´o

me, if you like, but you must refrain from interruptionr^ I want to

tell it. Badly. Nobt of it will sound like lying. So be it! Itâ©vN
trueâevery word of it, all the same. I was in my laboratory at four

oâclock, and since then â¦ Iâve lived eight days â¦ such days as no human

being ever lived before! Iæm nearly worn out, but I shanât sleep till

Iâve told this thing ¯ver to you. Then I shall go ´o bed. But no

interruptions! Is it agreed?â



âAgreed,â$³aid the Editor, and the rest of us echoed âAgreed.â And with

that the Time Traveller$¢egan his story as I have set it forth. Ie$sat

back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man. Afterwards he

got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only too much

keenness the inadequacy of pen and inkâand, above all, ­y$¯gn

ina¤equacyâto express iuc quality. ou read, I will seppose,

attentively enough; but you cannot sUe the speakerâs white, sincere

face in the bright circle of the little$¬amp, noa hear the intonation

of his voice. You cannot know how his exprev¦on followed the turns of

hisT³tory! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in the
smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the$face of the Journalist

and the legrof the Silent Man from the «nees downward were

illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each other. After a

time we ceased to dothat, and looked only at the Time Travellerâs

face.
